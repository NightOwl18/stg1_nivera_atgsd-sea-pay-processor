# stg1_nivera_atgsd-sea-pay-processor
Automated US Navy Sea Pay PG-13 Generator for ATG San Diego. Processes Sea Pay date ranges, inserts member data, formats the PG-13 using AcroForm fields, and outputs a ready-to-sign PDF. Built for Unraid/Docker deployment.


This project automates the creation of the NAVPERS 1070/613 Sea Pay PG-13 using AcroForm PDF fields. It processes input data such as member name, dates (formatted like “8/4/25 to 8/8/25”), and duty section details, then generates a completed, printer-ready PG-13.

Designed for STG1 Nivera (ATGSD) and optimized for Unraid and Docker use
